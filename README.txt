This is an experimental project in which I'm developing regularized
regression methods for fitting Markov substitution models on
trees. I've used code from the PHAST project to get started, but that
does not imply any endorsement by that project's authors. You can find
more information about their nice software at http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/phast
